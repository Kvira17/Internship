## How to write your work log

> Use this log to record your weekly activities for the Electronics Lab Internship.  
> For each day, briefly write:
> - date
> - Start / End time (optional)
> - What you worked on (e.g., testing a sensor, setting up Arduino, writing code)
> - What you learned or observed
> - Any challenges you faced (if any)
>
> Keep it concise, but make sure someone else reading it can understand what you did.
